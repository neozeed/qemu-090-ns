This is a weird/speical fork of Qemu 0.90 that had a busmouse patch and an IRQ fix allowing NeXTSTEP to run on Qemu.
Now you may be asking why this incredibly old version?  Well simply put It's FAST and the disks work.  NeXTSTEP is
very picky about disks, and something broke all these years ago.

Ive also added a UDP networking update, allowing Qemu to talk to dynamips & HecnetNT so you can easily bridge it.

Rhapsoy changes all the mouse buttons, I guess someone had hard coded a left handed mouse button schema.  I'm left
handed but even this confuses me, so I added the "rhapsodymouse" option to revert the buttons to normal.  Only
Rhapsody suffers this weirdness, NeXTSTEP / OPENSTEP don't suffer this.

Since the busmouse uses IRQ 5, I've altered the SoundBlaster to use IRQ 7, and disabled the parallel port by default.
Who prints anyways?

This is how I run Rhapsody:

-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<
qemu -L pc-bios -m 128 ^
-k en-us ^
-rhapsodymouse ^
-soundhw sb16 ^
-hda rhapsody-8g.vmdk ^
-net nic,model=ne2k_pci,vlan=1 ^
-net socket,udp=127.0.0.1:5001,remote=127.0.0.1:5000,vlan=1 ^
-boot c
-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<

Darwin/NeXTSTEP/OPENSTEP can use 512MB of RAM fine enough, there is some weird low cap on Rhapsody.

In my case the hecnetnt bridge is setup like this:

-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<
[bridge]
KM-TEST \Device\NPF_{9C34511A-3DB1-4ABF-BD95-4AACF3848A7F}
update  127.0.0.1:5001

[tcpip]
update
KM-TEST
-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<

And I run it as:

-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<
hecnet.exe 5000
-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<-------8<

This lets me FTP/telnet into the VM greatly easing data transfer so I don't have to mess with virtual floppies/CD-ROM's.
